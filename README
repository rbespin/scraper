HOW TO USE:

1) Place folder into desired directory.
2) cd into proper directory containing all files
3) chmod 777 run.sh
4) call `make` in terminal to run program

TIPS:
Place all file contents into the home directory (~), so that
on startup of a terminal, you can simply type `make` to run
the program. 

Otherwise, you'll have to cd into proper folder and then run make
